Description: Userspace interface to etnaviv-specific kernel DRM services -- runtime
 This library implements the userspace interface to the kernel DRM
 services.  DRM stands for "Direct Rendering Manager", which is the
 kernelspace portion of the "Direct Rendering Infrastructure" (DRI).
 The DRI is currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated
 OpenGL drivers.
