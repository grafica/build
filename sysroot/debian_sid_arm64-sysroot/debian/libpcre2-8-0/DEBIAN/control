Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library- 8 bit runtime files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the 8 bit runtime library.
