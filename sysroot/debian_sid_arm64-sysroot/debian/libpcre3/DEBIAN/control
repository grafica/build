Description: Old Perl 5 Compatible Regular Expression Library - runtime files
 This is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
 .
 New packages should use the newer pcre2 packages, and existing
 packages should migrate to pcre2.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries.
