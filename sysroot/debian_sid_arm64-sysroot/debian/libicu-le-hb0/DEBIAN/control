Description: ICU Layout Engine API on top of HarfBuzz shaping library
 A library implementing the ICU Layout Engine (icu-le) API using external
 HarfBuzz library for implementation.  This is useful as a compatibility layer
 to make applications using ICU Layout Engine to use HarfBuzz without porting
 them to use the HarfBuzz API.
 .
 The code is mostly a trimmed down version of icu/source/layout, with all
 shapers stripped out, and HarfBuzz integrated.
