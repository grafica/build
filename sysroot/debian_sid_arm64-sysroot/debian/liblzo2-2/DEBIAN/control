Description: data compression library
 LZO is a portable, lossless data compression library.
 It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression.
 Decompression requires no memory.  In addition there are slower
 compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio
 while still decompressing at this very high speed.
