Description: library of graphic data types (development files)
 Graphene provides a small set of mathematical types needed to implement
 graphic libraries that deal with 2D and 3D transformations and projections.
 .
 This library provides types and their relative API; it does not deal with
 windowing system surfaces, drawing, scene graphs, or input.
 .
 This package contains the header files required for developing software that
 uses libgraphene.
