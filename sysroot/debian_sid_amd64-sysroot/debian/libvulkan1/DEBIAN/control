Description: Vulkan loader library
 The Loader implements the main VK library. It handles layer management and
 driver management. The loader fully supports multi-gpu operation. As part of
 this, it dispatches API calls to the correct driver, and to the correct
 layers, based on the GPU object selected by the application.
 .
 This package includes the loader library.
