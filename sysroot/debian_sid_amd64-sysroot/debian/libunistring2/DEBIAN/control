Description: Unicode string library for C
 The 'libunistring' library implements Unicode strings (in the UTF-8,

 characters (character names, classifications, properties) and
 functions for string processing (formatted output, width, word
 breaks, line breaks, normalization, case folding, regular
 expressions).
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
